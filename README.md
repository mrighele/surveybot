# surveybot

A bot to handle surveys using BotKit and a bit of NLP

# Thanks

Since I suck at both NLP and the Slack api, I couldn't have done anything without some examples.
This project is based on the code of _bottie_ by Andrew Templeton: https://github.com/andrew-templeton/bottie
I also found his blog post about the project very useful to start: http://blog.templeton.host/self-training-nlp-enabled-slack-bot-tutorial/
